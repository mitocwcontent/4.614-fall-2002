description: 'Madrasa of Sultan al-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub (1243): first madrasa in
  Cairo to accommodate the four schools of law. Built in the heart of the Fatimid
  city, it was composed of two separate, self-contained courtyard units, parallel
  in plan, separated by a passage, and having each two large iwans. A mausoleum for
  the founder was added shortly after the completion of the complex by Shajar al-Durr,
  his wife.'
