description: The Gur-i-Amir Mausoleum in Samarqand (1404). Initially a religious complex
  appropriated to build a tomb for Timur's grandson Muhammad Sultan, it became the
  burial place for Timur and his male descendants. It formed a part of a larger religious
  complex, and a later madrasa abutted on its side. The double-shell dome achieves
  both an interior harmony and an exterior verticality.
