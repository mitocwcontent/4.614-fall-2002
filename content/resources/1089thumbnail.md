description: 'The Mosque of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in Cairo (1318 and 1335): this
  hypostyle structure is distinguished by the arrangement of alternate courses of
  red and black stone in its arches and niches, and by its two unusual minarets which
  may have been a direct import from Ilkhanid Iran.'
