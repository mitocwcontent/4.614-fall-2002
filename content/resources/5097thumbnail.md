description: Mosque of Hassan II Casablanca, Morocco (1986-93). A gigantic mosque
  by the sea, this is the epitome of new state symbols magnified by the royal dynasty's
  claim of prophetic lineage. The architecture and decoration of the mosque are predicated
  on the idea that the architectural language of the past is the only legitimate one.
  The French architect, Michel Pinseau, was thus limited in his design to explorations
  of monumentality and opulence.
