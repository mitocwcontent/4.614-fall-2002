description: Sherefudin's White Mosque, Visoko, Bosnia (1980). Designed by the architect
  Zlatko Ulgjen, it masterfully assimilates modern influences, especially Le Corbusier's
  Ronchamp Cathedral, and traditional Ottoman forms and elements. This mosque is firmly
  anchored in the present, but whose indebtness to its past is well-articulated.
