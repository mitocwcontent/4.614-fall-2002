description: 'The Masjid-i Jomeh at Isfahan (9th century, 11th and 12th century):
  An early hypostyle Abbasid mosque with cylindrical, brick piers to which the Seljuqs
  added two monumental and extraordinary domes, one on the qibla side (built by Nizam
  al-Mulk between 1072 and 1075) and one on the northern side (1088-89), and four
  iwans with pishtaks in the centers of its four porticoes overlooking the courtyard
  built in the early 12th century. It is the most cited example of the transformation
  from hypostyle plan to four-iwan plan.'
