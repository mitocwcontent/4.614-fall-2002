description: National Assembly Mosque, Ankara, Turkey (1987-89). A modernist place
  of worship for a secularist government, this mosque was designed by the Cinici group.
  Constructed in exposed concrete, the mosque displays innovative abstractions of
  all the traditional elements of Islamic architecture. The plexiglass mihrab adds
  an unusual symbolic touch by alluding to the notion of the mihrab as the gate to
  the luminous hereafter.
