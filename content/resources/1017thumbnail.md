description: 'The Mosque of Ibn-Tulun: The furthest westerly evidence of the spread
  of the Abbasid imperial style. This mosque is distinguished by its combination of
  columns and piers (eastern and western influences), its spiralling minaret and exclusive
  dependence on brick as a building material. Its porticos are composed of brick piers
  with four engaged brick columns which run along its four sides.'
