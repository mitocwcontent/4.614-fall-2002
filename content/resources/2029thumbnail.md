description: The Dolmabah?e Mosque, Istanbul (1852-53). Is built by the first of the
  Balian family of architects, Karabet, as an adaptation of a neo-classical style
  to the requirements of a small royal mosque. Its minarets take the shape of Corinthian
  columns. It, and the palace that gave it its name, are two examples of the strong
  influence of Western models in late Ottoman architecture.
