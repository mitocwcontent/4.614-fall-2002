description: The Mosque of Sultan Hasan (1356-61). The most monumental of all Cairene
  mosques, it stands like a fortress across from the Citadel of Cairo. The structure
  is a four-iwan, four-madrasa composition with a mausoleum right on the qibla axis
  of the mosque. The huge portal is oriented to impress the viewer coming from the
  Citadel. Its minarets mark the beginning of the line of development of the 3-tiered
  Mamluk minarets.
