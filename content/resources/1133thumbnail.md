description: The Church of Hagia Sofia (Ayasofia) (532-37). The edifice that most
  affected the Ottoman architects and patrons as an object of admiration and probably
  imitation. Sinan is reported to have felt relieved only when he completed his dome
  of the Selimiye Mosque at Edirne which equaled the width of Ayasofia's dome.
