description: The Funerary-Religious Complex of Sultan Qaytbay (1472-74). Probably
  the most beautiful funerary complex in Cairo, it has a mosque, a madrasa, and a
  qubba. It also has the most elegant 3-tiered minaret and the most intricately-carved
  stone dome with stellar patterns. (Image courtesy of the Fine Arts Library of the
