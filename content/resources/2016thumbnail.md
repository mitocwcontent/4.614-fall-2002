description: The Taj Mahal in Agra (1632-54). (Crown Palace) The majestic mausoleum
  built for the empress Mumtaz Mahal by her husband Shah Jahan. Iconographically highly
  charged, it represents the epitome of Islamic mausolea. Its plan is that of a Hasht
  Bihisht with four minarets framing it on the four sides of its square platform.
