description: The Mosque of al-Rifai in Cairo. Begun in 1869 and designed in a neo-Mamluk
  style, the mosque was left unfinished until 1906 when Max Herz Bey, the famous restorer
  of Islamic monuments in Cairo completed it. It stands opposite the grand mosque
  of Sultan Hasan as an attempt of the Khedival family to measure up to the achievements
  of the Mamluks.
