description: 'Stucco Decoration, Samarra Style: the style tended towards the abstraction
  of scrolls, stems, and leaves that belonged to the decorative vocabulary of Antiquity.
  Following the degree of abstraction, three styles have been identified: Style A:
  vine-leave ornament bearing resemblance to the Hellenistic, naturalizing origin.
  Style B: vegetal ornament with some abstraction such as no stalks from which the
  leaves grow. Style C: moulded pattern, very abstract with a combination of vegetal
  and geometric motifs. Patterns are normally inscribed within borders.'
