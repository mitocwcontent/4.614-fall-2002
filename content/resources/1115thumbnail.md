description: The Bibi-Khanum Mosque in Samarqand (1399-1404). Popularly named after
  Timur's wife, this is the mosque he intended to be the royal monument. Its tall
  projecting portal, with its flanking minarets was repeated inside in the qibla iwan.
  The mosque displays Timur's concern for monumental effect and theatrical arrangement.
